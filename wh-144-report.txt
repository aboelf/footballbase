### 3. Odds Movement Analysis
Does it matter if the odds moved to 1.44 or started there?

*   **Odds Unchanged (Init: 1.44 -> Final: 1.44):**
    *   Win Rate: **88.89%** (16/18)
    *   *Insight:* This appears to be the most reliable signal.

*   **Odds Rose to 1.44 (e.g., started at 1.36):**
    *   Win Rate: **83.33%** (25/30)
    *   *Insight:* Even when the market loses some confidence (odds rising), the win rate remains very high.

*   **Odds Dropped to 1.44 (e.g., started at 1.50):**
    *   Win Rate: **80.43%** (37/46)
    *   *Insight:* When money comes in on the home team (steaming the odds down), the win rate is actually slightly *lower* than when the odds are stable or drifting up, though still very good.

### 4. Goal Difference Analysis (Handicap Betting)
Winning margin for Home Wins in the 1.44 odds group:

*   **Win by > 1 Goal (GD >= 2):**
    *   **51 Matches** (54.26% of all 1.44 matches)
    *   **65.38%** of winning matches.
    *   *Insight:* Majority of wins cover a -1 handicap. The odds of this happening are slightly better than a coin flip (54% overall).

*   **Win by > 2 Goals (GD >= 3):**
    *   **25 Matches** (26.60% of all 1.44 matches)
    *   **32.05%** of winning matches.
    *   *Insight:* High risk for -2 handicap betting. Only about 1 in 4 matches result in a blowout.

## Recommendation
*   **High Confidence:** William Hill final odds of 1.44 in Ligue 1 or Bundesliga.
*   **High Confidence:** William Hill odds opening and closing at 1.44.
*   **Good Value:** Betting on **Home Team -1.5** (Asian Handicap) or **-1** (European Handicap) offers a reasonable strike rate (65% of wins cover this).
*   **Avoid:** Betting on **Home Team -2.5** or higher, as this rarely happens (only 26% of the time).
